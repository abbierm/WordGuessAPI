        Welcome! WordGuessAPI is a wordle clone you play by making API calls. Ideally this was created to to test and provide a large amount of feedback and data for people who programmed their own wordle solvers.

    <h1>How To Play Wordle</h1>
    <p>At the website: #TODO PUT WEBSITE HERE once a day a new 5 letter word is chosen. Users have 6 guesses to try and figure out what the word is.  After each guess, the website will display the user's guess with a color coded background based on the correct word. The different colors are: </p>
    <ul class="color-list">
        <li><mark style="background-color: #17614a; color: white;"> Green </mark>: The letter is in the word and in the correct spot</li>
        <li><span style="background-color: #b59d3e; color: black;"> Yellow </span>: The letter is in the word but not in the correct spot</li>
        <li><mark style="background-color: #3a3a3c; color: white;"> Grey </mark>: The letter is not in the word (or has already been accounted for in another guess spot)</li>

    <h1>How to play WordGuessAPI</h1>
    <p>To emulate the color feedback Wordle gives, WordGuessAPI returns a 5 character string with a 'G' (Green), 'Y' (Yellow), or 'B' (Grey/Black). Guess feedback is sent back to the player inside of a nested json (part of a larger payload) dictionary. If the Wordle screenshot above was played via WordGuessAPI instead, the feedback would look like: 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-json">
{
    "1": {"guess": "GREAT", "feedback": "BBYBB"},
    "2": {"guess": "SLIME", "feedback": "BBYBG"},
    "3": {"guess": "INDIE", "feedback": "YBBGG"},
    "4": {"guess": "PIXIE", "feedback": "GGGGG"}
}
    </code></pre>

<div class="how-to-play" style="text-align: left;">
    <h2>Requesting A Token</h2>
        <p>Registered users can start a game session by requesting a token using their username and password using a basic auth protocol. Tokens allow the user to interact with the API for 30 min until needing to request another.</p>

    <pre><code class="language-python">
import requests
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth

basic_auth = HTTPBasicAuth(
    "your unique username",
    "your user's password"
)

url = "https://www.wordguess_api.com/api/tokens"

token_payload = requests.post(
    url=url,
    auth=basic_auth
)
            </code></pre>

        <p>Tokens are returned in the following JSON format</p>
        <pre><code class="language-json">
{
    "token": "your unique 30 min token"
}
                        </code></pre>
